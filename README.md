######*fastlane* lets you define and run your deployment pipelines for different environments. It helps you unify your apps release process and automate the whole process. fastlane connects all fastlane tools and third party tools, like [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) and [xctool](https://github.com/facebook/xctool).

## Features

Why should you have to remember complicated commands and parameters?

Store your configuration in a text file to easily test, builld, and deploy from _any_ computer.

Just edit the ```Fastfile``` to define multiple ```lanes```, or different workflows.

Examples are: ```appstore```, ```beta``` and ```test```.

You define a ```lane``` like this (more details about the commands in the [Actions](https://github.com/KrauseFx/fastlane/blob/master/docs/Actions.md) documentation):

```ruby
lane :appstore do
  increment_build_number
  cocoapods
  xctool
  snapshot
  sigh
  deliver
  frameit
  sh "./customScript.sh"

  slack
end
```

To launch the ```appstore``` lane, just run:

```sh
fastlane appstore
```

Fastlane can do a lot for you to automate tedious and time-consuming parts of your job. 

- Connect all tools, part of the ```fastlane``` toolchain to work seamlessly together.
- Define different ```deployment lanes``` for App Store deployment, beta builds or testing.
- Deploy from any computer.
- [Jenkins Integration](https://github.com/KrauseFx/fastlane/blob/master/docs/Jenkins.md): Show the output directly in the Jenkins test results.
- Write your [own actions](https://github.com/KrauseFx/fastlane/blob/master/docs#extensions) (extensions) to extend the functionality of `fastlane`.
- Store data like the ```Bundle Identifier``` or your ```Apple ID``` once and use it across all tools.
- Never remember any difficult commands, just ```fastlane```.
- Easy setup, which helps you getting up and running very fast.
- [Shared context](https://github.com/KrauseFx/fastlane/blob/master/docs/Advanced.md#lane-context), which is used to let the different deployment steps communicate with each other.
- Store **everything** in git. Never lookup the used build commands in the ```Jenkins``` configs.
- Saves you **hours** of preparing app submission, uploading screenshots and deploying the app for each update.
- Very flexible configuration using a fully customizable `Fastfile`.
- Once up and running, you have a fully working **Continuous Deployment** process. Just trigger ```fastlane``` and you're good to go.
- Over 30 built-in integrations available.

##### Take a look at the [fastlane website](https://fastlane.tools) for more information about why and when to use `fastlane`.

## Installation

I recommend following the [fastlane guide](https://github.com/KrauseFx/fastlane/blob/master/docs/Guide.md) to get started.

If you are familiar with the command line and Ruby, install `fastlane` yourself:

    sudo gem install fastlane

Make sure, you have the latest version of the Xcode command line tools installed:

    xcode-select --install

If you want to take a look at a project, already using `fastlane`, check out the [fastlane-examples](https://github.com/fastlane/examples) with `fastlane` setups by Wikipedia, Product Hunt, MindNode and more.

## Quick Start

The setup assistant will create all the necessary files for you, using the existing app metadata from iTunes Connect.

- ```cd [your_project_folder]```
- ```fastlane init```
- Follow the setup assistant, which will set up ```fastlane``` for you
- Further customise the ```Fastfile``` with [actions](https://github.com/KrauseFx/fastlane/blob/master/docs/Actions.md).

For more details, please follow the [fastlane guide](https://github.com/KrauseFx/fastlane/blob/master/docs/Guide.md) or [documentation](https://github.com/KrauseFx/fastlane/blob/master/docs).

## Available commands

Usually you'll use fastlane by triggering individual lanes:

    fastlane [lane_name]

#### Other commands

- `fastlane lanes`: Lists all available lanes
- `fastlane docs`: Generates a markdown based documentation of all your lanes
- `fastlane actions`: List all available `fastlane` actions
- `fastlane action [action_name]`: Shows a more detailed description of an action
- `fastlane new_action`: Create a new action (integration) for fastlane  

## [`fastlane`](https://fastlane.tools) Toolchain

`fastlane` is designed to make your life easier by bringing together the `fastlane` suite of tools under one roof. 

- [`deliver`](https://github.com/KrauseFx/deliver): Upload screenshots, metadata and your app to the App Store using a single command
- [`snapshot`](https://github.com/KrauseFx/snapshot): Automate taking localized screenshots of your iOS app on every device
- [`frameit`](https://github.com/KrauseFx/frameit): Quickly put your screenshots into the right device frames
- [`PEM`](https://github.com/KrauseFx/pem): Automatically generate and renew your push notification profiles
- [`sigh`](https://github.com/KrauseFx/sigh): Because you would rather spend your time building stuff than fighting provisioning
- [`produce`](https://github.com/KrauseFx/produce): Create new iOS apps on iTunes Connect and Dev Portal using the command line
- [`cert`](https://github.com/KrauseFx/cert): Automatically create and maintain iOS code signing certificates
- [`codes`](https://github.com/KrauseFx/codes): Create promo codes for iOS Apps using the command line

## Statistics

`fastlane` tracks the number of errors for each action to detect integration issues. The data will be sent to [fastlane-enhancer](https://github.com/fastlane/enhancer) and is available publicly.

You can easily opt-out by adding `opt_out_usage` to your `Fastfile` or by setting the environment variable `FASTLANE_OPT_OUT_USAGE`.

## Credentials
A detailed description about how ```fastlane``` stores your credentials is available on a [separate repo](https://github.com/KrauseFx/CredentialsManager).
